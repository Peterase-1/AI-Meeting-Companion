John Smith: Good morning, everyone! Thanks for joining the meeting. Today, we’ll go over the project updates and the next steps for the AI integration.

Alice: Morning! I’ve completed the initial data preprocessing, and the dataset is ready for model training.

Bob: That’s great, Alice. I ran some preliminary tests on the model architecture, and the results look promising.

Carol: I have some concerns about the performance metrics. We might need to optimize the model further to reach our target accuracy.

David: Agreed. I can work on hyperparameter tuning and see if we can get better results by the end of this week.

John Smith: Perfect. Also, we need to finalize the API endpoints for the AI module. Alice, can you handle that?

Alice: Sure, I’ll set up the endpoints and share the documentation by tomorrow.

Bob: Do we also need to schedule a review session for the integration testing?

John Smith: Yes, let’s schedule it for Thursday at 3 PM. Everyone okay with that?

Carol: Works for me.

David: Same here.

John Smith: Excellent. That wraps up the main points. Thanks, everyone! Let’s touch base again on Thursday.
